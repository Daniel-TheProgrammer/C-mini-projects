//trying to create dynamic array to read 1 million+ words

I want to create a dynamic array so that it will be able to read approximately one million+ words but i'm having issues doing that.

The limited number of words it can read now is approximately 40000 using stack allocation.
That's, MAX_WORDS can't be approximately more than 40000.

Help highly welcomed
