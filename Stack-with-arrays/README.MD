# Stack With Arrays

This is an implementation of the Stack data structure using arrays in C.
A simple int array is used to demonstrate the the LIFO prpperties of a Stack.

## Description

The program has 4 main options
1. Push - Adds value to stack is stack is not full
2. Pop - Removes last element from stack (LIFO)
3. Display - Which displays the current elements in the stack
4. Size of stack - Which gives the present size of the satck
4. Top of stack - Which gives the element at the top of the stack

### Notes
- The variable MAX defines the maximum number supported by the array
- The stack is an array of intergers as defined by 'int stack[MAX]'
- The program crashes when character values are entered as option or pushed values
