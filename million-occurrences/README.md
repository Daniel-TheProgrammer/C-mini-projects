# million-occurrences
This is a c program that reads the characters from a source text file and outputs the words and number of occurrences of each word in a text file named output

# C program to count the occurrences of all the distinct words in a file

# words_occurrences1 
//opens the input file and displays output on the screen 

# words_occurrences2 
//opens two files and save output to file named output

# words_occurrencesv3
//creates dynamic array to read 1 million+ words

I created a dynamic array so that it will be able to read approximately one million+ words.


The limited number of words v1 and v2 can read is approximately 40000 using stack allocation.
That's, MAX_WORDS can't be approximately more than 40000.

v3 reads 1 million+ words
